/**
 * A client to Policy Simulator API
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= OrgPolicyViolationsPreviewServiceClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Violations Preview API service for OrgPolicy.
 *
 * <p>An [OrgPolicyViolationsPreview][google.cloud.policysimulator.v1.OrgPolicyViolationsPreview] is
 * a preview of the violations that will exist as soon as a proposed OrgPolicy change is submitted.
 * To create an
 * [OrgPolicyViolationsPreview][google.cloud.policysimulator.v1.OrgPolicyViolationsPreview], the API
 * user specifies the changes they wish to make and requests the generation of a preview via
 * [GenerateViolationsPreview][]. the OrgPolicy Simulator service then scans the API user's
 * currently existing resources to determine these resources violate the newly set OrgPolicy.
 *
 * <p>Sample for OrgPolicyViolationsPreviewServiceClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (OrgPolicyViolationsPreviewServiceClient orgPolicyViolationsPreviewServiceClient =
 *     OrgPolicyViolationsPreviewServiceClient.create()) {
 *   OrgPolicyViolationsPreviewName name =
 *       OrgPolicyViolationsPreviewName.of(
 *           "[ORGANIZATION]", "[LOCATION]", "[ORG_POLICY_VIOLATIONS_PREVIEW]");
 *   OrgPolicyViolationsPreview response =
 *       orgPolicyViolationsPreviewServiceClient.getOrgPolicyViolationsPreview(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>======================= SimulatorClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Policy Simulator API service.
 *
 * <p>Policy Simulator is a collection of endpoints for creating, running, and viewing a
 * [Replay][google.cloud.policysimulator.v1.Replay]. A
 * [Replay][google.cloud.policysimulator.v1.Replay] is a type of simulation that lets you see how
 * your principals' access to resources might change if you changed your IAM policy.
 *
 * <p>During a [Replay][google.cloud.policysimulator.v1.Replay], Policy Simulator re-evaluates, or
 * replays, past access attempts under both the current policy and your proposed policy, and
 * compares those results to determine how your principals' access might change under the proposed
 * policy.
 *
 * <p>Sample for SimulatorClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (SimulatorClient simulatorClient = SimulatorClient.create()) {
 *   ReplayName name =
 *       ReplayName.ofProjectLocationReplayName("[PROJECT]", "[LOCATION]", "[REPLAY]");
 *   Replay response = simulatorClient.getReplay(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
