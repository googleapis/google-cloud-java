/**
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 * Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different view of
 * the data.  Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time
 * series in the set is _aligned_ to the same time interval boundaries, then the
 * set of time series is optionally _reduced_ in number.
 * Alignment consists of applying the `per_series_aligner` operation
 * to each time series after its data has been divided into regular
 * `alignment_period` time intervals. This process takes _all_ of the data
 * points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as
 * averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single
 * data point per period.
 * Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be
 * combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical
 * transformations. Reduction involves applying a `cross_series_reducer` to
 * all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with
 * `group_by_fields`, and applying the reducer to each subset.
 * The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from
 * multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into
 * a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example "the
 * 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster". This
 * representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the
 * individual time series data is still available for later drilldown. For more
 * details, see [Filtering and
 * aggregation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/aggregation).

  /**
   *
   *
   * <pre>
   * Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different view of
   * the data.  Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time
   * series in the set is _aligned_ to the same time interval boundaries, then the
   * set of time series is optionally _reduced_ in number.
   * Alignment consists of applying the `per_series_aligner` operation
   * to each time series after its data has been divided into regular
   * `alignment_period` time intervals. This process takes _all_ of the data
   * points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as
   * averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single
   * data point per period.
   * Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be
   * combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical
   * transformations. Reduction involves applying a `cross_series_reducer` to
   * all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with
   * `group_by_fields`, and applying the reducer to each subset.
   * The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from
   * multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into
   * a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example "the

     * partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation
     * operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same
     * value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time
     * series is a member of exactly one subset. The
     * `cross_series_reducer` is applied to each subset of time series.
     * It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so
     * this field implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
     * specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated away.  If
     * `group_by_fields` is not specified and all the time series have
     * the same resource type, then the time series are aggregated into
     * a single output time series. If `cross_series_reducer` is not
     * defined, this field is ignored.
