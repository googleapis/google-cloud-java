/**
 * Service Description: Service that implements Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (TextToSpeechClient textToSpeechClient = TextToSpeechClient.create()) {
 *   String languageCode = "languageCode-2092349083";
 *   ListVoicesResponse response = textToSpeechClient.listVoices(languageCode);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the TextToSpeechClient object to clean up resources such
 * as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().

 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of TextToSpeechSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * TextToSpeechSettings textToSpeechSettings =
 *     TextToSpeechSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * TextToSpeechClient textToSpeechClient = TextToSpeechClient.create(textToSpeechSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in

 * TextToSpeechSettings textToSpeechSettings =
 *     TextToSpeechSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * TextToSpeechClient textToSpeechClient = TextToSpeechClient.create(textToSpeechSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To use REST (HTTP1.1/JSON) transport (instead of gRPC) for sending and receiving requests over
 * the wire:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * TextToSpeechSettings textToSpeechSettings = TextToSpeechSettings.newHttpJsonBuilder().build();
 * TextToSpeechClient textToSpeechClient = TextToSpeechClient.create(textToSpeechSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
