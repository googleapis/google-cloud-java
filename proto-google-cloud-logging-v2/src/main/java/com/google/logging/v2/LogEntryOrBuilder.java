   * Optional. The ID of the [Cloud Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace) span
   * associated with the current operation in which the log is being written.
   * For example, if a span has the REST resource name of
   * "projects/some-project/traces/some-trace/spans/some-span-id", then the
   * `span_id` field is "some-span-id".
   *
   * A
   * [Span](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/projects.traces/batchWrite#Span)
   * represents a single operation within a trace. Whereas a trace may involve
   * multiple different microservices running on multiple different machines,
   * a span generally corresponds to a single logical operation being performed
   * in a single instance of a microservice on one specific machine. Spans
   * are the nodes within the tree that is a trace.
   *
   * Applications that are [instrumented for
   * tracing](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/setup) will generally assign a
   * new, unique span ID on each incoming request. It is also common to create
   * and record additional spans corresponding to internal processing elements
   * as well as issuing requests to dependencies.
   *
   * The span ID is expected to be a 16-character, hexadecimal encoding of an
   * 8-byte array and should not be zero. It should be unique within the trace
   * and should, ideally, be generated in a manner that is uniformly random.
   *
   * Example values:
   *
   *   - `000000000000004a`
