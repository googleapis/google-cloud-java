/**
 * Service Description: Provides methods for handling `DeviceManufacturer` objects.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (DeviceManufacturerServiceClient deviceManufacturerServiceClient =
 *     DeviceManufacturerServiceClient.create()) {
 *   DeviceManufacturerName name =
 *       DeviceManufacturerName.of("[NETWORK_CODE]", "[DEVICE_MANUFACTURER]");
 *   DeviceManufacturer response = deviceManufacturerServiceClient.getDeviceManufacturer(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the DeviceManufacturerServiceClient object to clean up
 * resources such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically
 * calls close().

 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of
 * DeviceManufacturerServiceSettings to create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * DeviceManufacturerServiceSettings deviceManufacturerServiceSettings =
 *     DeviceManufacturerServiceSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * DeviceManufacturerServiceClient deviceManufacturerServiceClient =
 *     DeviceManufacturerServiceClient.create(deviceManufacturerServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in

 * DeviceManufacturerServiceClient deviceManufacturerServiceClient =
 *     DeviceManufacturerServiceClient.create(deviceManufacturerServiceSettings);
