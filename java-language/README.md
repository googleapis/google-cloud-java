## Quickstart


If you are using Maven with [BOM][libraries-bom], add this to your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>libraries-bom</artifactId>
      <version>26.56.0</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>google-cloud-language</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

If you are using Maven without the BOM, add this to your dependencies:


```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-cloud-language</artifactId>
  <version>2.60.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle without BOM, add this to your dependencies:

```Groovy
implementation 'com.google.cloud:google-cloud-language:2.60.0'
```

If you are using SBT, add this to your dependencies:

```Scala
libraryDependencies += "com.google.cloud" % "google-cloud-language" % "2.60.0"
```

## Authentication

See the [Authentication][authentication] section in the base directory's README.

## Authorization

The client application making API calls must be granted [authorization scopes][auth-scopes] required for the desired Natural Language APIs, and the authenticated principal must have the [IAM role(s)][predefined-iam-roles] required to access GCP resources using the Natural Language API calls.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a [Google Cloud Platform Console][developer-console] project with the Natural Language [API enabled][enable-api].
You will need to [enable billing][enable-billing] to use Google Natural Language.
[Follow these instructions][create-project] to get your project set up. You will also need to set up the local development environment by
[installing the Google Cloud Command Line Interface][cloud-cli] and running the following commands in command line:
`gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project [YOUR PROJECT ID]`.

### Installation and setup

You'll need to obtain the `google-cloud-language` library.  See the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section
to add `google-cloud-language` as a dependency in your code.

## About Natural Language


[Natural Language][product-docs] provides natural language understanding technologies to developers, including sentiment analysis, entity analysis, entity sentiment analysis, content classification, and syntax analysis. This API is part of the larger Cloud Machine Learning API family.

See the [Natural Language client library docs][javadocs] to learn how to
use this Natural Language Client Library.


#### Analyzing sentiment
With Cloud Natural Language, you can analyze the sentiment of text. Add the following imports at the top of your file:

``` java
import com.google.cloud.language.v1.LanguageServiceClient;
import com.google.cloud.language.v1.Document;
import com.google.cloud.language.v1.Document.Type;
import com.google.cloud.language.v1.Sentiment;
```
Then, to analyze the sentiment of some text, use the following code:

``` java
// Instantiates a client
LanguageServiceClient language = LanguageServiceClient.create();

// The text to analyze
String[] texts = {"I love this!", "I hate this!"};
for (String text : texts) {
  Document doc = Document.newBuilder().setContent(text).setType(Type.PLAIN_TEXT).build();
  // Detects the sentiment of the text
  Sentiment sentiment = language.analyzeSentiment(doc).getDocumentSentiment();

  System.out.printf("Text: \"%s\"%n", text);
  System.out.printf(
      "Sentiment: score = %s, magnitude = %s%n",
      sentiment.getScore(), sentiment.getMagnitude());
}
```

#### Complete source code

In [AnalyzeSentiment.java](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/blob/master/google-cloud-examples/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/examples/language/snippets/AnalyzeSentiment.java) we put the code shown above into a complete program.




## Troubleshooting

To get help, follow the instructions in the [shared Troubleshooting document][troubleshooting].

## Transport

Natural Language uses both gRPC and HTTP/JSON for the transport layer.

## Supported Java Versions

Java 8 or above is required for using this client.

Google's Java client libraries,
[Google Cloud Client Libraries][cloudlibs]
and
[Google Cloud API Libraries][apilibs],
follow the
[Oracle Java SE support roadmap][oracle]
(see the Oracle Java SE Product Releases section).

### For new development

In general, new feature development occurs with support for the lowest Java
LTS version covered by  Oracle's Premier Support (which typically lasts 5 years
from initial General Availability). If the minimum required JVM for a given
library is changed, it is accompanied by a [semver][semver] major release.

Java 11 and (in September 2021) Java 17 are the best choices for new
development.

### Keeping production systems current

Google tests its client libraries with all current LTS versions covered by
Oracle's Extended Support (which typically lasts 8 years from initial
General Availability).

#### Legacy support

Google's client libraries support legacy versions of Java runtimes with long
term stable libraries that don't receive feature updates on a best efforts basis
as it may not be possible to backport all patches.

Google provides updates on a best efforts basis to apps that continue to use
Java 7, though apps might need to upgrade to current versions of the library
that supports their JVM.

#### Where to find specific information

The latest versions and the supported Java versions are identified on
the individual GitHub repository `github.com/GoogleAPIs/java-SERVICENAME`
and on [google-cloud-java][g-c-j].
