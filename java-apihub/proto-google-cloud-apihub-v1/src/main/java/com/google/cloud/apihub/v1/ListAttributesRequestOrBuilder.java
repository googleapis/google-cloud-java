   *
   * <pre>
   * Optional. An expression that filters the list of Attributes.
   *
   * A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison
   * operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a string or a
   * boolean. The comparison operator must be one of: `&lt;`, `&gt;` or
   * `=`. Filters are not case sensitive.
   *
   * The following fields in the `Attribute` are eligible for filtering:
   *
   *   * `display_name` - The display name of the Attribute. Allowed
   *   comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `definition_type` - The definition type of the attribute. Allowed
   *   comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `scope` - The scope of the attribute. Allowed comparison operators:
   *   `=`.
   *   * `data_type` - The type of the data of the attribute. Allowed
   *   comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `mandatory` - Denotes whether the attribute is mandatory or not.
   *   Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `create_time` - The time at which the Attribute was created. The
   *   value should be in the (RFC3339)[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339]
   *   format. Allowed comparison operators: `&gt;` and `&lt;`.
   *
   * Expressions are combined with either `AND` logic operator or `OR` logical
   * operator but not both of them together i.e. only one of the `AND` or `OR`
   * operator can be used throughout the filter string and both the operators
   * cannot be used together. No other logical operators are
   * supported. At most three filter fields are allowed in the filter
   * string and if provided more than that then `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is
   * returned by the API.
   *
   * Here are a few examples:
   *
   *   * `display_name = production` -  - The display name of the attribute is
   *   _production_.
   *   * `(display_name = production) AND (create_time &lt;
   *   &#92;"2021-08-15T14:50:00Z&#92;") AND (create_time &gt; &#92;"2021-08-10T12:00:00Z&#92;")` -
   *   The display name of the attribute is _production_ and the attribute was
   *   created before _2021-08-15 14:50:00 UTC_ and after _2021-08-10 12:00:00
   *   UTC_.
   *   * `display_name = production OR scope = api` -
   *   The attribute where the display name is _production_ or the scope is
   *   _api_.
