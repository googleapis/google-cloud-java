   * Optional. An expression that filters the list of ApiOperations.
   *
   * A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison
   * operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a string or a
   * boolean. The comparison operator must be one of: `&lt;`, `&gt;` or
   * `=`. Filters are not case sensitive.
   *
   * The following fields in the `ApiOperation` are eligible for filtering:
   *   * `name` - The ApiOperation resource name. Allowed comparison
   *   operators:
   *   `=`.
   *   * `details.http_operation.path.path` - The http operation's complete path
   *   relative to server endpoint. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `details.http_operation.method` - The http operation method type.
   *   Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `details.deprecated` - Indicates if the ApiOperation is deprecated.
   *   Allowed values are True / False indicating the deprycation status of the
   *   ApiOperation. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `create_time` - The time at which the ApiOperation was created. The
   *   value should be in the (RFC3339)[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339]
   *   format. Allowed comparison operators: `&gt;` and `&lt;`.
   *
   * Expressions are combined with either `AND` logic operator or `OR` logical
   * operator but not both of them together i.e. only one of the `AND` or `OR`
   * operator can be used throughout the filter string and both the operators
   * cannot be used together. No other logical operators are supported. At most
   * three filter fields are allowed in the filter string and if provided
   * more than that then `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned by the API.
   *
   * Here are a few examples:
   *
   *   * `details.deprecated = True` -  The ApiOperation is deprecated.
   *   * `details.http_operation.method = GET AND create_time &lt;
   *   &#92;"2021-08-15T14:50:00Z&#92;" AND create_time &gt; &#92;"2021-08-10T12:00:00Z&#92;"` -
   *   The method of the http operation of the ApiOperation is _GET_ and the
   *   spec was created before _2021-08-15 14:50:00 UTC_ and after _2021-08-10
   *   12:00:00 UTC_.
   *   * `details.http_operation.method = GET OR details.http_operation.method =
   *   POST`. - The http operation of the method of ApiOperation is _GET_ or
   *   _POST_.
