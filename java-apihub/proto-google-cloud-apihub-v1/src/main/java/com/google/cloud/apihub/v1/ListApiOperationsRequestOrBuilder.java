   *
   * <pre>
   * Optional. An expression that filters the list of ApiOperations.
   *
   * A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison
   * operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a string or a
   * boolean. The comparison operator must be one of: `&lt;`, `&gt;` or
   * `=`. Filters are not case sensitive.
   *
   * The following fields in the `ApiOperation` are eligible for filtering:
   *   * `name` - The ApiOperation resource name. Allowed comparison
   *   operators:
   *   `=`.
   *   * `details.http_operation.path.path` - The http operation's complete path
   *   relative to server endpoint. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `details.http_operation.method` - The http operation method type.
   *   Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `details.deprecated` - Indicates if the ApiOperation is deprecated.
   *   Allowed values are True / False indicating the deprycation status of the
   *   ApiOperation. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `create_time` - The time at which the ApiOperation was created. The
   *   value should be in the (RFC3339)[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339]
   *   format. Allowed comparison operators: `&gt;` and `&lt;`.
   *   * `attributes.projects/test-project-id/locations/test-location-id/
   *   attributes/user-defined-attribute-id.enum_values.values.id` - The
   *   allowed value id of the user defined enum attribute associated with the
   *   Resource. Allowed comparison operator is `:`. Here
   *   user-defined-attribute-enum-id is a placeholder that can be replaced with
   *   any user defined enum attribute name.
   *   * `attributes.projects/test-project-id/locations/test-location-id/
   *   attributes/user-defined-attribute-id.enum_values.values.display_name`
   *   - The allowed value display name of the user defined enum attribute
   *   associated with the Resource. Allowed comparison operator is `:`. Here
   *   user-defined-attribute-enum-display-name is a placeholder that can be
   *   replaced with any user defined enum attribute enum name.
   *   * `attributes.projects/test-project-id/locations/test-location-id/
   *   attributes/user-defined-attribute-id.string_values.values` - The
   *   allowed value of the user defined string attribute associated with the
   *   Resource. Allowed comparison operator is `:`. Here
   *   user-defined-attribute-string is a placeholder that can be replaced with
   *   any user defined string attribute name.
   *   * `attributes.projects/test-project-id/locations/test-location-id/
   *   attributes/user-defined-attribute-id.json_values.values` - The
   *   allowed value of the user defined JSON attribute associated with the
   *   Resource. Allowed comparison operator is `:`. Here
   *   user-defined-attribute-json is a placeholder that can be replaced with
   *   any user defined JSON attribute name.
   *
   * Expressions are combined with either `AND` logic operator or `OR` logical
   * operator but not both of them together i.e. only one of the `AND` or `OR`
   * operator can be used throughout the filter string and both the operators
   * cannot be used together. No other logical operators are supported. At most
   * three filter fields are allowed in the filter string and if provided
   * more than that then `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned by the API.
   *
   * Here are a few examples:
   *
   *   * `details.deprecated = True` -  The ApiOperation is deprecated.
   *   * `details.http_operation.method = GET AND create_time &lt;
   *   &#92;"2021-08-15T14:50:00Z&#92;" AND create_time &gt; &#92;"2021-08-10T12:00:00Z&#92;"` -
