/**
 * Service Description: [Service Control API
 * v2](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-control/access-control)
 *
 * <p>This API provides admission control and telemetry reporting for services that are integrated
 * with [Service Infrastructure](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure).
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (ServiceControllerClient serviceControllerClient = ServiceControllerClient.create()) {
 *   CheckRequest request =
 *       CheckRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setServiceName("serviceName-1928572192")
 *           .setServiceConfigId("serviceConfigId650537426")
 *           .setAttributes(AttributeContext.newBuilder().build())
 *           .addAllResources(new ArrayList<ResourceInfo>())
 *           .setFlags("flags97513095")
 *           .build();
 *   CheckResponse response = serviceControllerClient.check(request);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the ServiceControllerClient object to clean up resources
 * such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls
 * close().
 *
 * <table>
 *    <caption>Methods</caption>
 *    <tr>
 *      <th>Method</th>
 *      <th>Description</th>
 *      <th>Method Variants</th>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *      <td><p> Check</td>
 *      <td><p> This method provides admission control for services that are integrated with [Service Infrastructure](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure). It checks whether an operation should be allowed based on the service configuration and relevant policies. It must be called before the operation is executed. For more information, see [Admission Control](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/admission-control).
 * <p>  NOTE: The admission control has an expected policy propagation delay of 60s. The caller &#42;&#42;must&#42;&#42; not depend on the most recent policy changes.
 * <p>  NOTE: The admission control has a hard limit of 1 referenced resources per call. If an operation refers to more than 1 resources, the caller must call the Check method multiple times.
 * <p>  This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.check` permission on the specified service. For more information, see [Service Control API Access Control](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-control/access-control).</td>
 *      <td>
 *      <p>Request object method variants only take one parameter, a request object, which must be constructed before the call.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *           <li><p> check(CheckRequest request)
 *      </ul>
 *      <p>Callable method variants take no parameters and return an immutable API callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *           <li><p> checkCallable()
 *      </ul>
 *       </td>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *      <td><p> Report</td>
 *      <td><p> This method provides telemetry reporting for services that are integrated with [Service Infrastructure](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure). It reports a list of operations that have occurred on a service. It must be called after the operations have been executed. For more information, see [Telemetry Reporting](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/telemetry-reporting).
 * <p>  NOTE: The telemetry reporting has a hard limit of 100 operations and 1MB per Report call.
 * <p>  This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.report` permission on the specified service. For more information, see [Service Control API Access Control](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-control/access-control).</td>
 *      <td>
 *      <p>Request object method variants only take one parameter, a request object, which must be constructed before the call.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *           <li><p> report(ReportRequest request)
 *      </ul>
 *      <p>Callable method variants take no parameters and return an immutable API callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *           <li><p> reportCallable()
 *      </ul>
 *       </td>
 *    </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of ServiceControllerSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * ServiceControllerSettings serviceControllerSettings =
 *     ServiceControllerSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * ServiceControllerClient serviceControllerClient =
 *     ServiceControllerClient.create(serviceControllerSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * ServiceControllerSettings serviceControllerSettings =
 *     ServiceControllerSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * ServiceControllerClient serviceControllerClient =
 *     ServiceControllerClient.create(serviceControllerSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To use REST (HTTP1.1/JSON) transport (instead of gRPC) for sending and receiving requests over
 * the wire:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * ServiceControllerSettings serviceControllerSettings =
 *     ServiceControllerSettings.newHttpJsonBuilder().build();
 * ServiceControllerClient serviceControllerClient =
 *     ServiceControllerClient.create(serviceControllerSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
