   * default value is `2000`.

   * field, make sure the CPU resources for both fields are compatible with each
   * other and with how many tasks you want to allow to run on the same VM at
   * the same time.
   *
   * For example, if you specify the `n2-standard-2` machine type, which has 2
   * vCPUs each, you are recommended to set `cpuMilli` no more than `2000`, or
