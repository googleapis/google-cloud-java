   * The syntax for this expression is a subset of SQL syntax.
   * Supported operators are: `=`, `!=`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`, and `~~` where
   * the left of the operator is a property name and the right of the operator
   * is a number or a quoted string. You must escape backslash (&#92;&#92;) and quote
   * (&#92;") characters.
   * `~~` is the LIKE operator. The right of the operator must be a string. The
   * only supported property data type for LIKE is text_values. It provides
   * semantic search functionality by parsing, stemming and doing synonyms
   * expansion against the input query. It matches if the property contains
   * semantic similar content to the query. It is not regex matching or wildcard
   * matching. For example, "property.company ~~ &#92;"google&#92;"" will match records
   * whose property `property.compnay` have values like "Google Inc.", "Google
   * LLC" or "Google Company".
   * Supported functions are `LOWER([property_name])` to perform a
   * case insensitive match and `EMPTY([property_name])` to filter on the
   * existence of a key.
   * Boolean expressions (AND/OR/NOT) are supported up to 3 levels of nesting
   * (for example, "((A AND B AND C) OR NOT D) AND E"), a maximum of 100
   * comparisons or functions are allowed in the expression. The expression must
   * be &lt; 6000 bytes in length.
   * Only properties that are marked filterable are allowed
   * ([PropertyDefinition.is_filterable][google.cloud.contentwarehouse.v1.PropertyDefinition.is_filterable]). Property names do not need to be
   * prefixed by the document schema id (as is the case with histograms),
   * however property names will need to be prefixed by its parent hierarchy, if
   * any.  For example: top_property_name.sub_property_name.
   * Sample Query:
   * `(LOWER(driving_license)="class &#92;"a&#92;"" OR EMPTY(driving_license)) AND
   * driving_years &gt; 10`
   * CMEK compliant deployment only supports:
   * * Operators: `=`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, and `&gt;=`.
