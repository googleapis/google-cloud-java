 *
 * <p>&#42; `google.protobuf.Timestamp` &#42; Times are in Unix time: seconds since
 * 1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00. &#42; seconds must be in [0, 253402300799], i.e. in
 * [1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00, 9999-12-31T23:59:59+00:00]. &#42; nanos must be unset or set to 0.

   * Optimizes vehicle tours for one or more `OptimizeToursRequest` messages as a batch.

   * <p>This method is a Long Running Operation (LRO). The inputs for optimization
   * (`OptimizeToursRequest` messages) and outputs (`OptimizeToursResponse` messages) are read from
   * and written to Cloud Storage in user-specified format. Like the `OptimizeTours` method, each
   * `OptimizeToursRequest` contains a `ShipmentModel` and returns an `OptimizeToursResponse`
   * containing `ShipmentRoute` fields, which are a set of routes to be performed by vehicles
   * minimizing the overall cost.
   *
   * <p>The user can poll `operations.get` to check the status of the LRO:
   *
   * <p>If the LRO `done` field is false, then at least one request is still being processed. Other
   * requests may have completed successfully and their results are available in Cloud Storage.
   *
   * <p>If the LRO's `done` field is true, then all requests have been processed. Any successfully

   * will not have their results available in Cloud Storage. If the LRO's `error` field is set, then
