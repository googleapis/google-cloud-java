/**
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 * A vehicle's route can be decomposed, along the time axis, like this (we
 * assume there are n visits):
 * ```
 *   |            |            |          |       |  T[2], |        |      |
 *   | Transition |  Visit #0  |          |       |  V[2], |        |      |
 *   |     #0     |    aka     |   T[1]   |  V[1] |  ...   | V[n-1] | T[n] |
 *   |  aka T[0]  |    V[0]    |          |       | V[n-2],|        |      |
 *   |            |            |          |       | T[n-1] |        |      |
 *   ^            ^            ^          ^       ^        ^        ^      ^
 * vehicle    V[0].start   V[0].end     V[1].   V[1].    V[n].    V[n]. vehicle
 *  start     (arrival)   (departure)   start   end      start    end     end
 * ```
 * Note that we make a difference between:
 *
 * * "punctual events", such as the vehicle start and end and each visit's start
 *   and end (aka arrival and departure). They happen at a given second.
 * * "time intervals", such as the visits themselves, and the transition between
 *   visits. Though time intervals can sometimes have zero duration, i.e. start
 *   and end at the same second, they often have a positive duration.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *
 * * If there are n visits, there are n+1 transitions.
 * * A visit is always surrounded by a transition before it (same index) and a
 *   transition after it (index + 1).
 * * The vehicle start is always followed by transition #0.
 * * The vehicle end is always preceded by transition #n.
 *
 * Zooming in, here is what happens during a `Transition` and a `Visit`:
 * ```
 * ---+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+--&gt;
 *    |           TRANSITION[i]             |           VISIT[i]          |
 *    |                                     |                             |
 *    |  * TRAVEL: the vehicle moves from   |      PERFORM the visit:     |
 *    |    VISIT[i-1].departure_location to |                             |
 *    |    VISIT[i].arrival_location, which |  * Spend some time:         |
 *    |    takes a given travel duration    |    the "visit duration".    |
 *    |    and distance                     |                             |
 *    |                                     |  * Load or unload           |
 *    |  * BREAKS: the driver may have      |    some quantities from the |
 *    |    breaks (e.g. lunch break).       |    vehicle: the "demand".   |
 *    |                                     |                             |
 *    |  * WAIT: the driver/vehicle does    |                             |
 *    |    nothing. This can happen for     |                             |
 *    |    many reasons, for example when   |                             |
 *    |    the vehicle reaches the next     |                             |
 *    |    event's destination before the   |                             |
 *    |    start of its time window         |                             |
 *    |                                     |                             |
 *    |  * DELAY: *right before* the next   |                             |
 *    |    arrival. E.g. the vehicle and/or |                             |
 *    |    driver spends time unloading.    |                             |
 *    |                                     |                             |
 * ---+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+--&gt;
 *    ^                                     ^                             ^
 * V[i-1].end                           V[i].start                    V[i].end
 * ```
 * Lastly, here is how the TRAVEL, BREAKS, DELAY and WAIT can be arranged
 * during a transition.
 *
 * * They don't overlap.
 * * The DELAY is unique and *must* be a contiguous period of time right
 *   before the next visit (or vehicle end). Thus, it suffice to know the
 *   delay duration to know its start and end time.
 * * The BREAKS are contiguous, non-overlapping periods of time. The
 *   response specifies the start time and duration of each break.
 * * TRAVEL and WAIT are "preemptable": they can be interrupted several times
 *   during this transition. Clients can assume that travel happens "as soon as
 *   possible" and that "wait" fills the remaining time.
 *
 * A (complex) example:
 * ```
 *                                TRANSITION[i]
 * --++-----+-----------------------------------------------------------++--&gt;
 *   ||     |       |           |       |           |         |         ||
 *   ||  T  |   B   |     T     |       |     B     |         |    D    ||
 *   ||  r  |   r   |     r     |   W   |     r     |    W    |    e    ||

  /**
   *
   *
   * <pre>
   * A vehicle's route can be decomposed, along the time axis, like this (we
   * assume there are n visits):
   * ```
   *   |            |            |          |       |  T[2], |        |      |
   *   | Transition |  Visit #0  |          |       |  V[2], |        |      |
   *   |     #0     |    aka     |   T[1]   |  V[1] |  ...   | V[n-1] | T[n] |
   *   |  aka T[0]  |    V[0]    |          |       | V[n-2],|        |      |
   *   |            |            |          |       | T[n-1] |        |      |
   *   ^            ^            ^          ^       ^        ^        ^      ^
   * vehicle    V[0].start   V[0].end     V[1].   V[1].    V[n].    V[n]. vehicle
   *  start     (arrival)   (departure)   start   end      start    end     end
   * ```
   * Note that we make a difference between:
   *
   * * "punctual events", such as the vehicle start and end and each visit's start
   *   and end (aka arrival and departure). They happen at a given second.
   * * "time intervals", such as the visits themselves, and the transition between
   *   visits. Though time intervals can sometimes have zero duration, i.e. start
   *   and end at the same second, they often have a positive duration.
   *
   * Invariants:
   *
   * * If there are n visits, there are n+1 transitions.
   * * A visit is always surrounded by a transition before it (same index) and a
   *   transition after it (index + 1).
   * * The vehicle start is always followed by transition #0.
   * * The vehicle end is always preceded by transition #n.
   *
   * Zooming in, here is what happens during a `Transition` and a `Visit`:
   * ```
   * ---+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+--&gt;
   *    |           TRANSITION[i]             |           VISIT[i]          |
   *    |                                     |                             |
   *    |  * TRAVEL: the vehicle moves from   |      PERFORM the visit:     |
   *    |    VISIT[i-1].departure_location to |                             |
   *    |    VISIT[i].arrival_location, which |  * Spend some time:         |
   *    |    takes a given travel duration    |    the "visit duration".    |
   *    |    and distance                     |                             |
   *    |                                     |  * Load or unload           |
   *    |  * BREAKS: the driver may have      |    some quantities from the |
   *    |    breaks (e.g. lunch break).       |    vehicle: the "demand".   |
   *    |                                     |                             |
   *    |  * WAIT: the driver/vehicle does    |                             |
   *    |    nothing. This can happen for     |                             |
   *    |    many reasons, for example when   |                             |
   *    |    the vehicle reaches the next     |                             |
   *    |    event's destination before the   |                             |
   *    |    start of its time window         |                             |
   *    |                                     |                             |
   *    |  * DELAY: *right before* the next   |                             |
   *    |    arrival. E.g. the vehicle and/or |                             |
   *    |    driver spends time unloading.    |                             |
   *    |                                     |                             |
   * ---+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+--&gt;
   *    ^                                     ^                             ^
   * V[i-1].end                           V[i].start                    V[i].end
   * ```
   * Lastly, here is how the TRAVEL, BREAKS, DELAY and WAIT can be arranged
   * during a transition.
   *
   * * They don't overlap.
   * * The DELAY is unique and *must* be a contiguous period of time right
   *   before the next visit (or vehicle end). Thus, it suffice to know the
   *   delay duration to know its start and end time.
   * * The BREAKS are contiguous, non-overlapping periods of time. The
   *   response specifies the start time and duration of each break.
   * * TRAVEL and WAIT are "preemptable": they can be interrupted several times
   *   during this transition. Clients can assume that travel happens "as soon as
   *   possible" and that "wait" fills the remaining time.
   *
   * A (complex) example:
   * ```
   *                                TRANSITION[i]
   * --++-----+-----------------------------------------------------------++--&gt;
   *   ||     |       |           |       |           |         |         ||
   *   ||  T  |   B   |     T     |       |     B     |         |    D    ||
   *   ||  r  |   r   |     r     |   W   |     r     |    W    |    e    ||
   *   ||  a  |   e   |     a     |   a   |     e     |    a    |    l    ||
   *   ||  v  |   a   |     v     |   i   |     a     |    i    |    a    ||
   *   ||  e  |   k   |     e     |   t   |     k     |    t    |    y    ||
   *   ||  l  |       |     l     |       |           |         |         ||
   *   ||     |       |           |       |           |         |         ||
   * --++-----------------------------------------------------------------++--&gt;
