- [Client Library Documentation][javadocs]

> Note: This client is a work-in-progress, and may occasionally
> make backwards-incompatible changes.


## Quickstart


If you are using Maven with [BOM][libraries-bom], add this to your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>libraries-bom</artifactId>
      <version>26.38.0</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.shopping</groupId>
    <artifactId>google-shopping-merchant-notifications</artifactId>
  </dependency>
```

If you are using Maven without the BOM, add this to your dependencies:

<!-- {x-version-update-start:google-shopping-merchant-notifications:released} -->

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.shopping</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-shopping-merchant-notifications</artifactId>
  <version>0.18.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle without BOM, add this to your dependencies:

```Groovy
implementation 'com.google.shopping:google-shopping-merchant-notifications:0.18.0'
```

If you are using SBT, add this to your dependencies:

```Scala
libraryDependencies += "com.google.shopping" % "google-shopping-merchant-notifications" % "0.18.0"
```
<!-- {x-version-update-end} -->

## Authentication

See the [Authentication][authentication] section in the base directory's README.

## Authorization

The client application making API calls must be granted [authorization scopes][auth-scopes] required for the desired Merchant Notifications API APIs, and the authenticated principal must have the [IAM role(s)][predefined-iam-roles] required to access GCP resources using the Merchant Notifications API API calls.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a [Google Cloud Platform Console][developer-console] project with the Merchant Notifications API [API enabled][enable-api].
You will need to [enable billing][enable-billing] to use Google Merchant Notifications API.
[Follow these instructions][create-project] to get your project set up. You will also need to set up the local development environment by
[installing the Google Cloud Command Line Interface][cloud-cli] and running the following commands in command line:
`gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project [YOUR PROJECT ID]`.

### Installation and setup

You'll need to obtain the `google-shopping-merchant-notifications` library.  See the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section
to add `google-shopping-merchant-notifications` as a dependency in your code.

## About Merchant Notifications API


[Merchant Notifications API][product-docs] Programmatically manage your Merchant Center accounts.

See the [Merchant Notifications API client library docs][javadocs] to learn how to
use this Merchant Notifications API Client Library.






## Troubleshooting

To get help, follow the instructions in the [shared Troubleshooting document][troubleshooting].

## Transport

Merchant Notifications API uses both gRPC and HTTP/JSON for the transport layer.

## Supported Java Versions

Java 8 or above is required for using this client.

Google's Java client libraries,
[Google Cloud Client Libraries][cloudlibs]
and
[Google Cloud API Libraries][apilibs],
follow the
[Oracle Java SE support roadmap][oracle]
(see the Oracle Java SE Product Releases section).

### For new development

In general, new feature development occurs with support for the lowest Java
LTS version covered by  Oracle's Premier Support (which typically lasts 5 years
from initial General Availability). If the minimum required JVM for a given
library is changed, it is accompanied by a [semver][semver] major release.

Java 11 and (in September 2021) Java 17 are the best choices for new
development.

### Keeping production systems current

Google tests its client libraries with all current LTS versions covered by
Oracle's Extended Support (which typically lasts 8 years from initial
General Availability).

#### Legacy support

Google's client libraries support legacy versions of Java runtimes with long
term stable libraries that don't receive feature updates on a best efforts basis
as it may not be possible to backport all patches.

Google provides updates on a best efforts basis to apps that continue to use
Java 7, though apps might need to upgrade to current versions of the library
that supports their JVM.

#### Where to find specific information

The latest versions and the supported Java versions are identified on
the individual GitHub repository `github.com/GoogleAPIs/java-SERVICENAME`
and on [google-cloud-java][g-c-j].
