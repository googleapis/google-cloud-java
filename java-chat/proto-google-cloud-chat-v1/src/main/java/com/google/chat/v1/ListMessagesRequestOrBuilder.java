   * operator `&lt;` to list messages that were created before a timestamp. To
   * filter messages within a time interval, use the `AND` operator between two
   * timestamps.

   * `spaces/{space}/threads/{thread}`. You can only specify one
   * `thread.name` per query.
   *
   * To filter by both thread and date, use the `AND` operator in your query.
