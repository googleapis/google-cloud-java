   * A streamed result set consists of a stream of values, which might
   * be split into many `PartialResultSet` messages to accommodate
   * large rows and/or large values. Every N complete values defines a
   * row, where N is equal to the number of entries in
   * [metadata.row_type.fields][google.spanner.v1.StructType.fields].
   * Most values are encoded based on type as described
   * [here][google.spanner.v1.TypeCode].
   * It is possible that the last value in values is "chunked",
   * meaning that the rest of the value is sent in subsequent
   * `PartialResultSet`(s). This is denoted by the [chunked_value][google.spanner.v1.PartialResultSet.chunked_value]
   * field. Two or more chunked values can be merged to form a
   * complete value as follows:
   *   * `bool/number/null`: cannot be chunked
   *   * `string`: concatenate the strings
   *   * `list`: concatenate the lists. If the last element in a list is a
   *     `string`, `list`, or `object`, merge it with the first element in
   *     the next list by applying these rules recursively.
   *   * `object`: concatenate the (field name, field value) pairs. If a
   *     field name is duplicated, then apply these rules recursively
   *     to merge the field values.
   * Some examples of merging:
   *     # Strings are concatenated.
   *     "foo", "bar" =&gt; "foobar"
   *     # Lists of non-strings are concatenated.
   *     [2, 3], [4] =&gt; [2, 3, 4]
   *     # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
   *     # because they are strings.
   *     ["a", "b"], ["c", "d"] =&gt; ["a", "bc", "d"]
   *     # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
   *     # because they are lists. Recursively, the last and first elements
   *     # of the inner lists are merged because they are strings.
   *     ["a", ["b", "c"]], [["d"], "e"] =&gt; ["a", ["b", "cd"], "e"]
   *     # Non-overlapping object fields are combined.
   *     {"a": "1"}, {"b": "2"} =&gt; {"a": "1", "b": 2"}
   *     # Overlapping object fields are merged.
   *     {"a": "1"}, {"a": "2"} =&gt; {"a": "12"}
   *     # Examples of merging objects containing lists of strings.
   *     {"a": ["1"]}, {"a": ["2"]} =&gt; {"a": ["12"]}
   * For a more complete example, suppose a streaming SQL query is
   * yielding a result set whose rows contain a single string
   * field. The following `PartialResultSet`s might be yielded:
   *     {
   *       "metadata": { ... }
   *       "values": ["Hello", "W"]
   *       "chunked_value": true

   *       "resume_token": "Zx1B..."
   *     }
   * This sequence of `PartialResultSet`s encodes two rows, one
