   * For example, to have something repeat every weekday, you'd use:
   * `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR`
   * To repeat some window daily (equivalent to the DailyMaintenanceWindow):
   * `FREQ=DAILY`

   * `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=1;BYDAY=SA,SU`
   * This specifies how frequently the window starts. Eg, if you wanted to have

   * ```
   * start time = 2019-01-01T09:00:00-0400
   * end time = 2019-01-01T17:00:00-0400
   * recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR
   * ```
   * Windows can span multiple days. Eg, to make the window encompass every
   * weekend from midnight Saturday till the last minute of Sunday UTC:
   * ```
   * start time = 2019-01-05T00:00:00Z
   * end time = 2019-01-07T23:59:00Z
   * recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA
   * ```
   * Note the start and end time's specific dates are largely arbitrary except
   * to specify duration of the window and when it first starts.
   * The FREQ values of HOURLY, MINUTELY, and SECONDLY are not supported.
