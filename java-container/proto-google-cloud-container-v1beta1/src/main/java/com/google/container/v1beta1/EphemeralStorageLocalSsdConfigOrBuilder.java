   * <pre>
   * Number of local SSDs to use to back ephemeral storage. Uses NVMe
   * interfaces.
   *
   * A zero (or unset) value has different meanings depending on machine type
   * being used:
   * 1. For pre-Gen3 machines, which support flexible numbers of local ssds,
   * zero (or unset) means to disable using local SSDs as ephemeral storage. The
   * limit for this value is dependent upon the maximum number of disk
   * available on a machine per zone. See:
   * https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd
   * for more information.
   * 2. For Gen3 machines which dictate a specific number of local ssds, zero
   * (or unset) means to use the default number of local ssds that goes with
   * that machine type. For example, for a c3-standard-8-lssd machine, 2 local
   * ssds would be provisioned. For c3-standard-8 (which doesn't support local
   * ssds), 0 will be provisioned. See
   * https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#choose_number_local_ssds
   * for more info.
   * </pre>
   *
   * <code>int32 local_ssd_count = 1;</code>
   *
   * @return The localSsdCount.
