   * [AutoMl.ImportData][google.cloud.automl.v1.AutoMl.ImportData] when populating the dataset from which the model used
   * for the prediction had been trained.
   * The sentiment values are between 0 and
   * Dataset.text_sentiment_dataset_metadata.sentiment_max (inclusive),
   * with higher value meaning more positive sentiment. They are completely
   * relative, i.e. 0 means least positive sentiment and sentiment_max means
   * the most positive from the sentiments present in the train data. Therefore
   *  e.g. if train data had only negative sentiment, then sentiment_max, would
   * be still negative (although least negative).
   * The sentiment shouldn't be confused with "score" or "magnitude"
   * from the previous Natural Language Sentiment Analysis API.
