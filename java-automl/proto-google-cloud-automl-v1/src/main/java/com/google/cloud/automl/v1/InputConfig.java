 * <pre>
 * Input configuration for [AutoMl.ImportData][google.cloud.automl.v1.AutoMl.ImportData] action.
 * The format of input depends on dataset_metadata the Dataset into which
 * the import is happening has. As input source the
 * [gcs_source][google.cloud.automl.v1.InputConfig.gcs_source]
 * is expected, unless specified otherwise. Additionally any input .CSV file
 * by itself must be 100MB or smaller, unless specified otherwise.
 * If an "example" file (that is, image, video etc.) with identical content
 * (even if it had different `GCS_FILE_PATH`) is mentioned multiple times, then
 * its label, bounding boxes etc. are appended. The same file should be always
 * provided with the same `ML_USE` and `GCS_FILE_PATH`, if it is not, then
 * these values are nondeterministically selected from the given ones.
 * The formats are represented in EBNF with commas being literal and with
 * non-terminal symbols defined near the end of this comment. The formats are:
 * &lt;h4&gt;AutoML Vision&lt;/h4&gt;
 * &lt;div class="ds-selector-tabs"&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Classification&lt;/h5&gt;
 * See [Preparing your training

 * information.
 * CSV file(s) with each line in format:
 *     ML_USE,GCS_FILE_PATH,LABEL,LABEL,...
 * *   `ML_USE` - Identifies the data set that the current row (file) applies
 * to.
 *     This value can be one of the following:
 *     * `TRAIN` - Rows in this file are used to train the model.
 *     * `TEST` - Rows in this file are used to test the model during training.
 *     * `UNASSIGNED` - Rows in this file are not categorized. They are
 *        Automatically divided into train and test data. 80% for training and
 *        20% for testing.
 * *   `GCS_FILE_PATH` - The Google Cloud Storage location of an image of up to
 *      30MB in size. Supported extensions: .JPEG, .GIF, .PNG, .WEBP, .BMP,
 *      .TIFF, .ICO.
 * *   `LABEL` - A label that identifies the object in the image.
 * For the `MULTICLASS` classification type, at most one `LABEL` is allowed
 * per image. If an image has not yet been labeled, then it should be
 * mentioned just once with no `LABEL`.
 * Some sample rows:
 *     TRAIN,gs://folder/image1.jpg,daisy

 *     is assumed to be exhaustively labeled.
 * *  `LABEL` - A label that identifies the object in the image specified by the
 *    `BOUNDING_BOX`.
 * *  `BOUNDING BOX` - The vertices of an object in the example image.
 *    The minimum allowed `BOUNDING_BOX` edge length is 0.01, and no more than
 *    500 `BOUNDING_BOX` instances per image are allowed (one `BOUNDING_BOX`
 *    per line). If an image has no looked for objects then it should be
 *    mentioned just once with no LABEL and the ",,,,,,," in place of the
 *   `BOUNDING_BOX`.
 * **Four sample rows:**

 * CSV file(s) with each line in format:
 *     ML_USE,GCS_FILE_PATH
 * For `ML_USE`, do not use `VALIDATE`.
 * `GCS_FILE_PATH` is the path to another .csv file that describes training
 * example for a given `ML_USE`, using the following row format:
 *     GCS_FILE_PATH,(LABEL,TIME_SEGMENT_START,TIME_SEGMENT_END | ,,)
 * Here `GCS_FILE_PATH` leads to a video of up to 50GB in size and up
 * to 3h duration. Supported extensions: .MOV, .MPEG4, .MP4, .AVI.
 * `TIME_SEGMENT_START` and `TIME_SEGMENT_END` must be within the
 * length of the video, and the end time must be after the start time. Any
 * segment of a video which has one or more labels on it, is considered a
 * hard negative for all other labels. Any segment with no labels on
 * it is considered to be unknown. If a whole video is unknown, then
 * it should be mentioned just once with ",," in place of `LABEL,
 * TIME_SEGMENT_START,TIME_SEGMENT_END`.
 * Sample top level CSV file:

 * CSV file(s) with each line in format:
 *     ML_USE,GCS_FILE_PATH
 * For `ML_USE`, do not use `VALIDATE`.
 * `GCS_FILE_PATH` is the path to another .csv file that describes training
 * example for a given `ML_USE`, using the following row format:
 *     GCS_FILE_PATH,LABEL,[INSTANCE_ID],TIMESTAMP,BOUNDING_BOX
 * or
 *     GCS_FILE_PATH,,,,,,,,,,
 * Here `GCS_FILE_PATH` leads to a video of up to 50GB in size and up
 * to 3h duration. Supported extensions: .MOV, .MPEG4, .MP4, .AVI.
 * Providing `INSTANCE_ID`s can help to obtain a better model. When
 * a specific labeled entity leaves the video frame, and shows up
 * afterwards it is not required, albeit preferable, that the same
 * `INSTANCE_ID` is given to it.
 * `TIMESTAMP` must be within the length of the video, the
 * `BOUNDING_BOX` is assumed to be drawn on the closest video's frame
 * to the `TIMESTAMP`. Any mentioned by the `TIMESTAMP` frame is expected
 * to be exhaustively labeled and no more than 500 `BOUNDING_BOX`-es per
 * frame are allowed. If a whole video is unknown, then it should be
 * mentioned just once with ",,,,,,,,,," in place of `LABEL,
 * [INSTANCE_ID],TIMESTAMP,BOUNDING_BOX`.

 * information.
 * One or more CSV file(s) with each line in the following format:
 *     ML_USE,GCS_FILE_PATH
 * *   `ML_USE` - Identifies the data set that the current row (file) applies
 * to.
 *     This value can be one of the following:
 *     * `TRAIN` - Rows in this file are used to train the model.
 *     * `TEST` - Rows in this file are used to test the model during training.
 *     * `UNASSIGNED` - Rows in this file are not categorized. They are
 *        Automatically divided into train and test data. 80% for training and
 *        20% for testing..
 * *   `GCS_FILE_PATH` - a Identifies JSON Lines (.JSONL) file stored in
 *      Google Cloud Storage that contains in-line text in-line as documents
 *      for model training.
 * After the training data set has been determined from the `TRAIN` and
 * `UNASSIGNED` CSV files, the training data is divided into train and
 * validation data sets. 70% for training and 30% for validation.
 * For example:
 *     TRAIN,gs://folder/file1.jsonl
 *     VALIDATE,gs://folder/file2.jsonl
 *     TEST,gs://folder/file3.jsonl
 * **In-line JSONL files**
 * In-line .JSONL files contain, per line, a JSON document that wraps a
 * [`text_snippet`][google.cloud.automl.v1.TextSnippet] field followed by
 * one or more [`annotations`][google.cloud.automl.v1.AnnotationPayload]
 * fields, which have `display_name` and `text_extraction` fields to describe
 * the entity from the text snippet. Multiple JSON documents can be separated
 * using line breaks (&#92;n).
 * The supplied text must be annotated exhaustively. For example, if you
 * include the text "horse", but do not label it as "animal",
 * then "horse" is assumed to not be an "animal".
 * Any given text snippet content must have 30,000 characters or
 * less, and also be UTF-8 NFC encoded. ASCII is accepted as it is
 * UTF-8 NFC encoded.
 * For example:
 *     {
 *       "text_snippet": {
 *         "content": "dog car cat"
 *       },
 *       "annotations": [
 *          {
 *            "display_name": "animal",
 *            "text_extraction": {
 *              "text_segment": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 2}
 *           }
 *          },
 *          {
 *           "display_name": "vehicle",
 *            "text_extraction": {
 *              "text_segment": {"start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 6}
 *            }
 *          },
 *          {
 *            "display_name": "animal",
 *            "text_extraction": {
 *              "text_segment": {"start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 10}
 *            }
 *          }
 *      ]
 *     }&#92;n
 *     {
 *        "text_snippet": {
 *          "content": "This dog is good."
 *        },
 *        "annotations": [
 *           {
 *             "display_name": "animal",
 *             "text_extraction": {
 *               "text_segment": {"start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 7}
 *             }
 *           }
 *        ]
 *     }
 * **JSONL files that reference documents**
 * .JSONL files contain, per line, a JSON document that wraps a
 * `input_config` that contains the path to a source document.
 * Multiple JSON documents can be separated using line breaks (&#92;n).
 * Supported document extensions: .PDF, .TIF, .TIFF
 * For example:
 *     {
 *       "document": {
 *         "input_config": {
 *           "gcs_source": { "input_uris": [ "gs://folder/document1.pdf" ]
 *           }
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }&#92;n
 *     {
 *       "document": {
 *         "input_config": {
 *           "gcs_source": { "input_uris": [ "gs://folder/document2.tif" ]
 *           }
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 * **In-line JSONL files with document layout information**
 * **Note:** You can only annotate documents using the UI. The format described
 * below applies to annotated documents exported using the UI or `exportData`.
 * In-line .JSONL files for documents contain, per line, a JSON document
 * that wraps a `document` field that provides the textual content of the
 * document and the layout information.
 * For example:
 *     {
 *       "document": {
 *               "document_text": {
 *                 "content": "dog car cat"
 *               }
 *               "layout": [
 *                 {
 *                   "text_segment": {
 *                     "start_offset": 0,
 *                     "end_offset": 11,
 *                    },
 *                    "page_number": 1,

 *                     },
 *                     "text_segment_type": TOKEN,
 *                 }
 *               ],
 *               "document_dimensions": {

 * One or more CSV file(s) with each line in the following format:
 *     ML_USE,(TEXT_SNIPPET | GCS_FILE_PATH),LABEL,LABEL,...
 * *   `ML_USE` - Identifies the data set that the current row (file) applies
 * to.
 *     This value can be one of the following:
 *     * `TRAIN` - Rows in this file are used to train the model.
 *     * `TEST` - Rows in this file are used to test the model during training.
 *     * `UNASSIGNED` - Rows in this file are not categorized. They are
 *        Automatically divided into train and test data. 80% for training and
 *        20% for testing.
 * *   `TEXT_SNIPPET` and `GCS_FILE_PATH` are distinguished by a pattern. If
 *     the column content is a valid Google Cloud Storage file path, that is,
 *     prefixed by "gs://", it is treated as a `GCS_FILE_PATH`. Otherwise, if
 *     the content is enclosed in double quotes (""), it is treated as a
 *     `TEXT_SNIPPET`. For `GCS_FILE_PATH`, the path must lead to a
 *     file with supported extension and UTF-8 encoding, for example,
 *     "gs://folder/content.txt" AutoML imports the file content
 *     as a text snippet. For `TEXT_SNIPPET`, AutoML imports the column content
 *     excluding quotes. In both cases, size of the content must be 10MB or
 *     less in size. For zip files, the size of each file inside the zip must be
 *     10MB or less in size.
 *     For the `MULTICLASS` classification type, at most one `LABEL` is allowed.
 *     The `ML_USE` and `LABEL` columns are optional.
 *     Supported file extensions: .TXT, .PDF, .TIF, .TIFF, .ZIP
 * A maximum of 100 unique labels are allowed per CSV row.

 *     128kB or less in size.
 *     The `ML_USE` and `SENTIMENT` columns are optional.
 *     Supported file extensions: .TXT, .PDF, .TIF, .TIFF, .ZIP
 * *  `SENTIMENT` - An integer between 0 and
 *     Dataset.text_sentiment_dataset_metadata.sentiment_max
 *     (inclusive). Describes the ordinal of the sentiment - higher
 *     value means a more positive sentiment. All the values are
 *     completely relative, i.e. neither 0 needs to mean a negative or
 *     neutral sentiment nor sentiment_max needs to mean a positive one -
 *     it is just required that 0 is the least positive sentiment
 *     in the data, and sentiment_max is the  most positive one.
 *     The SENTIMENT shouldn't be confused with "score" or "magnitude"
 *     from the previous Natural Language Sentiment Analysis API.
 *     All SENTIMENT values between 0 and sentiment_max must be
 *     represented in the imported data. On prediction the same 0 to
 *     sentiment_max range will be used. The difference between
 *     neighboring sentiment values needs not to be uniform, e.g. 1 and
 *     2 may be similar whereas the difference between 2 and 3 may be
 *     large.
 * Sample rows:

 * size must be 100GB or smaller.
 * First three sample rows of a CSV file:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * "Id","First Name","Last Name","Dob","Addresses"
 * "1","John","Doe","1968-01-22","[{"status":"current","address":"123_First_Avenue","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","zip":"11111","numberOfYears":"1"},{"status":"previous","address":"456_Main_Street","city":"Portland","state":"OR","zip":"22222","numberOfYears":"5"}]"
 * "2","Jane","Doe","1980-10-16","[{"status":"current","address":"789_Any_Avenue","city":"Albany","state":"NY","zip":"33333","numberOfYears":"2"},{"status":"previous","address":"321_Main_Street","city":"Hoboken","state":"NJ","zip":"44444","numberOfYears":"3"}]}
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * **For bigquery_source:**
 * An URI of a BigQuery table. The user data size of the BigQuery
 * table must be 100GB or smaller.
 * An imported table must have between 2 and 1,000 columns, inclusive,
 * and between 1000 and 100,000,000 rows, inclusive. There are at most 5
 * import data running in parallel.
 *   &lt;/section&gt;
 * &lt;/div&gt;
 * **Input field definitions:**
 * `ML_USE`
 * : ("TRAIN" | "VALIDATE" | "TEST" | "UNASSIGNED")
 *   Describes how the given example (file) should be used for model
 *   training. "UNASSIGNED" can be used when user has no preference.
 * `GCS_FILE_PATH`
 * : The path to a file on Google Cloud Storage. For example,
 *   "gs://folder/image1.png".
 * `LABEL`
 * : A display name of an object on an image, video etc., e.g. "dog".
 *   Must be up to 32 characters long and can consist only of ASCII
 *   Latin letters A-Z and a-z, underscores(_), and ASCII digits 0-9.
 *   For each label an AnnotationSpec is created which display_name
 *   becomes the label; AnnotationSpecs are given back in predictions.
 * `INSTANCE_ID`
 * : A positive integer that identifies a specific instance of a
 *   labeled entity on an example. Used e.g. to track two cars on
 *   a video while being able to tell apart which one is which.
 * `BOUNDING_BOX`
 * : (`VERTEX,VERTEX,VERTEX,VERTEX` | `VERTEX,,,VERTEX,,`)
 *   A rectangle parallel to the frame of the example (image,
 *   video). If 4 vertices are given they are connected by edges
 *   in the order provided, if 2 are given they are recognized
 *   as diagonally opposite vertices of the rectangle.
 * `VERTEX`
 * : (`COORDINATE,COORDINATE`)
 *   First coordinate is horizontal (x), the second is vertical (y).
 * `COORDINATE`
 * : A float in 0 to 1 range, relative to total length of
 *   image or video in given dimension. For fractions the
 *   leading non-decimal 0 can be omitted (i.e. 0.3 = .3).
 *   Point 0,0 is in top left.
 * `TIME_SEGMENT_START`
 * : (`TIME_OFFSET`)
 *   Expresses a beginning, inclusive, of a time segment
 *   within an example that has a time dimension
 *   (e.g. video).
 * `TIME_SEGMENT_END`
 * : (`TIME_OFFSET`)
 *   Expresses an end, exclusive, of a time segment within
 *   n example that has a time dimension (e.g. video).
 * `TIME_OFFSET`
 * : A number of seconds as measured from the start of an
 *   example (e.g. video). Fractions are allowed, up to a
 *   microsecond precision. "inf" is allowed, and it means the end
 *   of the example.
 * `TEXT_SNIPPET`
 * : The content of a text snippet, UTF-8 encoded, enclosed within
 *   double quotes ("").
 * `DOCUMENT`
 * : A field that provides the textual content with document and the layout
 *   information.
 *  **Errors:**
 *  If any of the provided CSV files can't be parsed or if more than certain
 *  percent of CSV rows cannot be processed then the operation fails and
 *  nothing is imported. Regardless of overall success or failure the per-row
 *  failures, up to a certain count cap, is listed in
 *  Operation.metadata.partial_failures.

   * the import is happening has. As input source the
   * [gcs_source][google.cloud.automl.v1.InputConfig.gcs_source]
   * is expected, unless specified otherwise. Additionally any input .CSV file
   * by itself must be 100MB or smaller, unless specified otherwise.
   * If an "example" file (that is, image, video etc.) with identical content
   * (even if it had different `GCS_FILE_PATH`) is mentioned multiple times, then
   * its label, bounding boxes etc. are appended. The same file should be always
   * provided with the same `ML_USE` and `GCS_FILE_PATH`, if it is not, then
   * these values are nondeterministically selected from the given ones.
   * The formats are represented in EBNF with commas being literal and with
   * non-terminal symbols defined near the end of this comment. The formats are:
   * &lt;h4&gt;AutoML Vision&lt;/h4&gt;
   * &lt;div class="ds-selector-tabs"&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Classification&lt;/h5&gt;
   * See [Preparing your training

   * information.
   * CSV file(s) with each line in format:
   *     ML_USE,GCS_FILE_PATH,LABEL,LABEL,...
   * *   `ML_USE` - Identifies the data set that the current row (file) applies
   * to.
   *     This value can be one of the following:
   *     * `TRAIN` - Rows in this file are used to train the model.
   *     * `TEST` - Rows in this file are used to test the model during training.
   *     * `UNASSIGNED` - Rows in this file are not categorized. They are
   *        Automatically divided into train and test data. 80% for training and
   *        20% for testing.
   * *   `GCS_FILE_PATH` - The Google Cloud Storage location of an image of up to
   *      30MB in size. Supported extensions: .JPEG, .GIF, .PNG, .WEBP, .BMP,
   *      .TIFF, .ICO.
   * *   `LABEL` - A label that identifies the object in the image.
   * For the `MULTICLASS` classification type, at most one `LABEL` is allowed
   * per image. If an image has not yet been labeled, then it should be
   * mentioned just once with no `LABEL`.
   * Some sample rows:
   *     TRAIN,gs://folder/image1.jpg,daisy
   *     TEST,gs://folder/image2.jpg,dandelion,tulip,rose
   *     UNASSIGNED,gs://folder/image3.jpg,daisy

   * *   `ML_USE` - Identifies the data set that the current row (file) applies
   * to.
   *     This value can be one of the following:
   *     * `TRAIN` - Rows in this file are used to train the model.
   *     * `TEST` - Rows in this file are used to test the model during training.
   *     * `UNASSIGNED` - Rows in this file are not categorized. They are
   *        Automatically divided into train and test data. 80% for training and
   *        20% for testing.
   * *  `GCS_FILE_PATH` - The Google Cloud Storage location of an image of up to
   *     30MB in size. Supported extensions: .JPEG, .GIF, .PNG. Each image
   *     is assumed to be exhaustively labeled.
   * *  `LABEL` - A label that identifies the object in the image specified by the
   *    `BOUNDING_BOX`.
   * *  `BOUNDING BOX` - The vertices of an object in the example image.
   *    The minimum allowed `BOUNDING_BOX` edge length is 0.01, and no more than
   *    500 `BOUNDING_BOX` instances per image are allowed (one `BOUNDING_BOX`
   *    per line). If an image has no looked for objects then it should be
   *    mentioned just once with no LABEL and the ",,,,,,," in place of the
   *   `BOUNDING_BOX`.

   * CSV file(s) with each line in format:
   *     ML_USE,GCS_FILE_PATH
   * For `ML_USE`, do not use `VALIDATE`.

   * example for a given `ML_USE`, using the following row format:
   *     GCS_FILE_PATH,(LABEL,TIME_SEGMENT_START,TIME_SEGMENT_END | ,,)
   * Here `GCS_FILE_PATH` leads to a video of up to 50GB in size and up
   * to 3h duration. Supported extensions: .MOV, .MPEG4, .MP4, .AVI.
   * `TIME_SEGMENT_START` and `TIME_SEGMENT_END` must be within the
   * length of the video, and the end time must be after the start time. Any
   * segment of a video which has one or more labels on it, is considered a
   * hard negative for all other labels. Any segment with no labels on
   * it is considered to be unknown. If a whole video is unknown, then
   * it should be mentioned just once with ",," in place of `LABEL,

   * Here `GCS_FILE_PATH` leads to a video of up to 50GB in size and up
   * to 3h duration. Supported extensions: .MOV, .MPEG4, .MP4, .AVI.
   * Providing `INSTANCE_ID`s can help to obtain a better model. When
   * a specific labeled entity leaves the video frame, and shows up
   * afterwards it is not required, albeit preferable, that the same
   * `INSTANCE_ID` is given to it.
   * `TIMESTAMP` must be within the length of the video, the
   * `BOUNDING_BOX` is assumed to be drawn on the closest video's frame
   * to the `TIMESTAMP`. Any mentioned by the `TIMESTAMP` frame is expected
   * to be exhaustively labeled and no more than 500 `BOUNDING_BOX`-es per
   * frame are allowed. If a whole video is unknown, then it should be
   * mentioned just once with ",,,,,,,,,," in place of `LABEL,

   * One or more CSV file(s) with each line in the following format:
   *     ML_USE,GCS_FILE_PATH
   * *   `ML_USE` - Identifies the data set that the current row (file) applies
   * to.
   *     This value can be one of the following:
   *     * `TRAIN` - Rows in this file are used to train the model.
   *     * `TEST` - Rows in this file are used to test the model during training.
   *     * `UNASSIGNED` - Rows in this file are not categorized. They are
   *        Automatically divided into train and test data. 80% for training and
   *        20% for testing..
   * *   `GCS_FILE_PATH` - a Identifies JSON Lines (.JSONL) file stored in
   *      Google Cloud Storage that contains in-line text in-line as documents
   *      for model training.
   * After the training data set has been determined from the `TRAIN` and
   * `UNASSIGNED` CSV files, the training data is divided into train and
   * validation data sets. 70% for training and 30% for validation.
   * For example:
   *     TRAIN,gs://folder/file1.jsonl
   *     VALIDATE,gs://folder/file2.jsonl
   *     TEST,gs://folder/file3.jsonl
   * **In-line JSONL files**
   * In-line .JSONL files contain, per line, a JSON document that wraps a
   * [`text_snippet`][google.cloud.automl.v1.TextSnippet] field followed by
   * one or more [`annotations`][google.cloud.automl.v1.AnnotationPayload]
   * fields, which have `display_name` and `text_extraction` fields to describe
   * the entity from the text snippet. Multiple JSON documents can be separated
   * using line breaks (&#92;n).
   * The supplied text must be annotated exhaustively. For example, if you
   * include the text "horse", but do not label it as "animal",
   * then "horse" is assumed to not be an "animal".
   * Any given text snippet content must have 30,000 characters or
   * less, and also be UTF-8 NFC encoded. ASCII is accepted as it is
   * UTF-8 NFC encoded.
   * For example:
   *     {
   *       "text_snippet": {
   *         "content": "dog car cat"
   *       },
   *       "annotations": [
   *          {
   *            "display_name": "animal",
   *            "text_extraction": {
   *              "text_segment": {"start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 2}
   *           }
   *          },
   *          {
   *           "display_name": "vehicle",
   *            "text_extraction": {
   *              "text_segment": {"start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 6}
   *            }
   *          },
   *          {
   *            "display_name": "animal",
   *            "text_extraction": {
   *              "text_segment": {"start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 10}
   *            }
   *          }
   *      ]
   *     }&#92;n
   *     {
   *        "text_snippet": {
   *          "content": "This dog is good."
   *        },
   *        "annotations": [
   *           {
   *             "display_name": "animal",
   *             "text_extraction": {
   *               "text_segment": {"start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 7}
   *             }
   *           }
   *        ]
   *     }
   * **JSONL files that reference documents**
   * .JSONL files contain, per line, a JSON document that wraps a
   * `input_config` that contains the path to a source document.
   * Multiple JSON documents can be separated using line breaks (&#92;n).
   * Supported document extensions: .PDF, .TIF, .TIFF
   * For example:
   *     {
   *       "document": {
   *         "input_config": {
   *           "gcs_source": { "input_uris": [ "gs://folder/document1.pdf" ]
   *           }
   *         }
   *       }
   *     }&#92;n
   *     {
   *       "document": {
   *         "input_config": {
   *           "gcs_source": { "input_uris": [ "gs://folder/document2.tif" ]
   *           }
   *         }
   *       }
   *     }
   * **In-line JSONL files with document layout information**
   * **Note:** You can only annotate documents using the UI. The format described
   * below applies to annotated documents exported using the UI or `exportData`.
   * In-line .JSONL files for documents contain, per line, a JSON document
   * that wraps a `document` field that provides the textual content of the
   * document and the layout information.
   * For example:
   *     {
   *       "document": {
   *               "document_text": {
   *                 "content": "dog car cat"
   *               }
   *               "layout": [
   *                 {
   *                   "text_segment": {
   *                     "start_offset": 0,
   *                     "end_offset": 11,
   *                    },
   *                    "page_number": 1,

   * One or more CSV file(s) with each line in the following format:
   *     ML_USE,(TEXT_SNIPPET | GCS_FILE_PATH),LABEL,LABEL,...
   * *   `ML_USE` - Identifies the data set that the current row (file) applies

   *     the content is enclosed in double quotes (""), it is treated as a
   *     `TEXT_SNIPPET`. For `GCS_FILE_PATH`, the path must lead to a
   *     file with supported extension and UTF-8 encoding, for example,
   *     "gs://folder/content.txt" AutoML imports the file content
   *     as a text snippet. For `TEXT_SNIPPET`, AutoML imports the column content
   *     excluding quotes. In both cases, size of the content must be 10MB or

   * *  `SENTIMENT` - An integer between 0 and
   *     Dataset.text_sentiment_dataset_metadata.sentiment_max
   *     (inclusive). Describes the ordinal of the sentiment - higher
   *     value means a more positive sentiment. All the values are
   *     completely relative, i.e. neither 0 needs to mean a negative or
   *     neutral sentiment nor sentiment_max needs to mean a positive one -
   *     it is just required that 0 is the least positive sentiment
   *     in the data, and sentiment_max is the  most positive one.
   *     The SENTIMENT shouldn't be confused with "score" or "magnitude"
   *     from the previous Natural Language Sentiment Analysis API.
   *     All SENTIMENT values between 0 and sentiment_max must be
   *     represented in the imported data. On prediction the same 0 to
   *     sentiment_max range will be used. The difference between
   *     neighboring sentiment values needs not to be uniform, e.g. 1 and
   *     2 may be similar whereas the difference between 2 and 3 may be
   *     large.

   * import data running in parallel.
   *   &lt;/section&gt;
   * &lt;/div&gt;
   * **Input field definitions:**
   * `ML_USE`
   * : ("TRAIN" | "VALIDATE" | "TEST" | "UNASSIGNED")
   *   Describes how the given example (file) should be used for model
   *   training. "UNASSIGNED" can be used when user has no preference.
   * `GCS_FILE_PATH`
   * : The path to a file on Google Cloud Storage. For example,
   *   "gs://folder/image1.png".
   * `LABEL`
   * : A display name of an object on an image, video etc., e.g. "dog".
   *   Must be up to 32 characters long and can consist only of ASCII
   *   Latin letters A-Z and a-z, underscores(_), and ASCII digits 0-9.
   *   For each label an AnnotationSpec is created which display_name
   *   becomes the label; AnnotationSpecs are given back in predictions.
   * `INSTANCE_ID`
   * : A positive integer that identifies a specific instance of a
   *   labeled entity on an example. Used e.g. to track two cars on
   *   a video while being able to tell apart which one is which.
   * `BOUNDING_BOX`
   * : (`VERTEX,VERTEX,VERTEX,VERTEX` | `VERTEX,,,VERTEX,,`)
   *   A rectangle parallel to the frame of the example (image,
   *   video). If 4 vertices are given they are connected by edges
   *   in the order provided, if 2 are given they are recognized
   *   as diagonally opposite vertices of the rectangle.
   * `VERTEX`
   * : (`COORDINATE,COORDINATE`)
   *   First coordinate is horizontal (x), the second is vertical (y).
   * `COORDINATE`
   * : A float in 0 to 1 range, relative to total length of
   *   image or video in given dimension. For fractions the
   *   leading non-decimal 0 can be omitted (i.e. 0.3 = .3).
   *   Point 0,0 is in top left.
   * `TIME_SEGMENT_START`
   * : (`TIME_OFFSET`)
   *   Expresses a beginning, inclusive, of a time segment
   *   within an example that has a time dimension
   *   (e.g. video).
   * `TIME_SEGMENT_END`
   * : (`TIME_OFFSET`)
   *   Expresses an end, exclusive, of a time segment within
   *   n example that has a time dimension (e.g. video).
   * `TIME_OFFSET`
   * : A number of seconds as measured from the start of an
   *   example (e.g. video). Fractions are allowed, up to a
   *   microsecond precision. "inf" is allowed, and it means the end
   *   of the example.
   * `TEXT_SNIPPET`
   * : The content of a text snippet, UTF-8 encoded, enclosed within
   *   double quotes ("").
   * `DOCUMENT`
   * : A field that provides the textual content with document and the layout
   *   information.
   *  **Errors:**
   *  If any of the provided CSV files can't be parsed or if more than certain
   *  percent of CSV rows cannot be processed then the operation fails and
   *  nothing is imported. Regardless of overall success or failure the per-row
   *  failures, up to a certain count cap, is listed in
   *  Operation.metadata.partial_failures.
