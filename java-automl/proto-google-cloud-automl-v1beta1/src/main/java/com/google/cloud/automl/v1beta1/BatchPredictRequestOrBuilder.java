   *    `score_threshold` - (float) When Model detects objects on video frames,
   *        it will only produce bounding boxes which have at least this
   *        confidence score. Value in 0 to 1 range, default is 0.5.
   *    `max_bounding_box_count` - (int64) No more than this number of bounding
   *        boxes will be returned per frame. Default is 100, the requested
   *        value may be limited by server.
   *    `min_bounding_box_size` - (float) Only bounding boxes with shortest edge
   *      at least that long as a relative value of video frame size will be
   *      returned. Value in 0 to 1 range. Default is 0.
