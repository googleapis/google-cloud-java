  /**

   * The custom info type to annotate the surrogate with.
   * This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with
   * the name of the custom info type followed by the number of
   * characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the
   * format: {info type name}({surrogate character count}):{surrogate}
   * For example, if the name of custom info type is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and
   * the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value
   * will be: 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc'
   * This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the
   * custom info type 'Surrogate'. This facilitates reversal of the
   * surrogate when it occurs in free text.
   * Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being
   * transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote
   * the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free
   * form text.
   * In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must
   * not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either
   * - reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier
   * - be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error
   * Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering
   * what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance
   * of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters
   * that are highly improbable to exist in your data.
   * For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard,
   * the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so:
   * ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE.
