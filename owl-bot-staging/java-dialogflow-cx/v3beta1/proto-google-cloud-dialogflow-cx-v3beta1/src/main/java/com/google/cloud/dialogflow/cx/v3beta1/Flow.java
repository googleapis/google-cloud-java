/**
 * <pre>
 * Flows represents the conversation flows when you build your chatbot agent.
 * A flow consists of many pages connected by the transition routes.
 * Conversations always start with the built-in Start Flow (with an all-0 ID).
 * Transition routes can direct the conversation session from the current flow
 * (parent flow) to another flow (sub flow). When the sub flow is finished,
 * Dialogflow will bring the session back to the parent flow, where the sub flow
 * is started.
 * Usually, when a transition route is followed by a matched intent, the intent
 * will be "consumed". This means the intent won't activate more transition
 * routes. However, when the followed transition route moves the conversation
 * session into a different flow, the matched intent can be carried over and to
 * be consumed in the target flow.
 * </pre>

  /**
   * <pre>
   * Flows represents the conversation flows when you build your chatbot agent.
   * A flow consists of many pages connected by the transition routes.
   * Conversations always start with the built-in Start Flow (with an all-0 ID).
   * Transition routes can direct the conversation session from the current flow
   * (parent flow) to another flow (sub flow). When the sub flow is finished,
   * Dialogflow will bring the session back to the parent flow, where the sub flow
   * is started.
   * Usually, when a transition route is followed by a matched intent, the intent
   * will be "consumed". This means the intent won't activate more transition
   * routes. However, when the followed transition route moves the conversation
   * session into a different flow, the matched intent can be carried over and to
   * be consumed in the target flow.
   * </pre>
   *
   * Protobuf type {@code google.cloud.dialogflow.cx.v3beta1.Flow}
