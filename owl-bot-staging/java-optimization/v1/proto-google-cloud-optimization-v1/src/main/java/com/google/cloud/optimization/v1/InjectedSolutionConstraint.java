       * If `relaxations` is empty, the start time and sequence of all visits
       * on `routes` are fully constrained and no new visits may be inserted or
       * added to those routes. Also, a vehicle's start and end time in
       * `routes` is fully constrained, unless the vehicle is empty (i.e., has no
       * visits and has `used_if_route_is_empty` set to false in the model).
       * `relaxations(i).level` specifies the constraint relaxation level applied
       * to a visit #j that satisfies:
       *   * `route.visits(j).start_time &gt;= relaxations(i).threshold_time` AND
       *   * `j + 1 &gt;= relaxations(i).threshold_visit_count`
       * Similarly, the vehicle start is relaxed to `relaxations(i).level` if it
       * satisfies:
       *   * `vehicle_start_time &gt;= relaxations(i).threshold_time` AND
       *   * `relaxations(i).threshold_visit_count == 0`
       * and the vehicle end is relaxed to `relaxations(i).level` if it satisfies:
       *   * `vehicle_end_time &gt;= relaxations(i).threshold_time` AND
       *   * `route.visits_size() + 1 &gt;= relaxations(i).threshold_visit_count`
       * To apply a relaxation level if a visit meets the `threshold_visit_count`
       * OR the `threshold_time` add two `relaxations` with the same `level`:
       * one with only `threshold_visit_count` set and the other with only
       * `threshold_time` set. If a visit satisfies the conditions of multiple
       * `relaxations`, the most relaxed level applies. As a result, from the
       * vehicle start through the route visits in order to the vehicle end, the
       * relaxation level becomes more relaxed: i.e., the relaxation level is
       * non-decreasing as the route progresses.
       * The timing and sequence of route visits that do not satisfy the
       * threshold conditions of any `relaxations` are fully constrained
       * and no visits may be inserted into these sequences. Also, if a
       * vehicle start or end does not satisfy the conditions of any
       * relaxation the time is fixed, unless the vehicle is empty.
