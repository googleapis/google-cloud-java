// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND CLASS.
/**
 * Service Description: Service for making recommendation prediction.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (PredictionServiceClient predictionServiceClient = PredictionServiceClient.create()) {
 *   PredictRequest request =
 *       PredictRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setPlacement("placement1792938725")
 *           .setUserEvent(UserEvent.newBuilder().build())
 *           .setPageSize(883849137)
 *           .setPageToken("pageToken873572522")
 *           .setFilter("filter-1274492040")
 *           .setValidateOnly(true)
 *           .putAllParams(new HashMap<String, Value>())
 *           .putAllLabels(new HashMap<String, String>())
 *           .build();
 *   PredictResponse response = predictionServiceClient.predict(request);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the PredictionServiceClient object to clean up resources
 * such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls
 * close().
 *
 * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A "flattened" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   <li>A "request object" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   <li>A "callable" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of PredictionServiceSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * PredictionServiceSettings predictionServiceSettings =
 *     PredictionServiceSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * PredictionServiceClient predictionServiceClient =
 *     PredictionServiceClient.create(predictionServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * PredictionServiceSettings predictionServiceSettings =
 *     PredictionServiceSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * PredictionServiceClient predictionServiceClient =
 *     PredictionServiceClient.create(predictionServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To use REST (HTTP1.1/JSON) transport (instead of gRPC) for sending and receiving requests over
 * the wire:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * PredictionServiceSettings predictionServiceSettings =
 *     PredictionServiceSettings.newHttpJsonBuilder().build();
 * PredictionServiceClient predictionServiceClient =
 *     PredictionServiceClient.create(predictionServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
