   * exactly one named segment (along with any number of unnamed segments) The
   * pattern will be matched over the field specified in the `field` field, then

   * - the name of the single named segment will be used as a header name,
   * - the match value of the segment will be used as a header value;
   * if the match is NOT successful, nothing will be sent.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   *               -- This is a field in the request message
   *              |   that the header value will be extracted from.

   *       specifies what to extract from the                    |

   *      The string in the field must match the whole pattern --
   *      before brackets, inside brackets, after brackets.
   *
   * When looking at this specific example, we can see that:
   * - A key-value pair with the key `table_location`
   *   and the value matching `instances/&#42;` should be added
   *   to the x-goog-request-params routing header.
   * - The value is extracted from the request message's `table_name` field
   *   if it matches the full pattern specified:
   *   `projects/&#42;&#47;instances/&#42;&#47;tables/&#42;`.
   *
   * **NB:** If the `path_template` field is not provided, the key name is
   * equal to the field name, and the whole field should be sent as a value.
   * This makes the pattern for the field and the value functionally equivalent
   * to `**`, and the configuration
   *
   *     {
   *       field: "table_name"
   *     }
   *
   * is a functionally equivalent shorthand to:
   *
   *     {
   *       field: "table_name"
   *       path_template: "{table_name=**}"
   *     }
