/**
 * Service Description: Web Risk API defines an interface to detect malicious URLs on your website
 * and in client applications.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (WebRiskServiceClient webRiskServiceClient = WebRiskServiceClient.create()) {
 *   ThreatType threatType = ThreatType.forNumber(0);
 *   ByteString versionToken = ByteString.EMPTY;
 *   ComputeThreatListDiffRequest.Constraints constraints =
 *       ComputeThreatListDiffRequest.Constraints.newBuilder().build();
 *   ComputeThreatListDiffResponse response =
 *       webRiskServiceClient.computeThreatListDiff(threatType, versionToken, constraints);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the WebRiskServiceClient object to clean up resources such
 * as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().

 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with

 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of WebRiskServiceSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in

 * WebRiskServiceSettings webRiskServiceSettings =

 *         .build();
 * WebRiskServiceClient webRiskServiceClient = WebRiskServiceClient.create(webRiskServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.

 *     WebRiskServiceSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * WebRiskServiceClient webRiskServiceClient = WebRiskServiceClient.create(webRiskServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To use REST (HTTP1.1/JSON) transport (instead of gRPC) for sending and receiving requests over
 * the wire:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
