   * Google Cloud Storage URI prefix where the results will be stored. Results
   * will be in JSON format and preceded by its corresponding input URI prefix.

   * either case, the uri should be unique because in order to get all of the
   * output files, you will need to do a wildcard gcs search on the uri prefix
   * you provide.
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   * *    File Prefix: gs://bucket-name/here/filenameprefix   The output files
   * will be created in gs://bucket-name/here/ and the names of the
   * output files will begin with "filenameprefix".
   *
   * *    Directory Prefix: gs://bucket-name/some/location/   The output files
   * will be created in gs://bucket-name/some/location/ and the names of the
   * output files could be anything because there was no filename prefix
   * specified.
   *
   * If multiple outputs, each response is still AnnotateFileResponse, each of
   * which contains some subset of the full list of AnnotateImageResponse.
   * Multiple outputs can happen if, for example, the output JSON is too large
   * and overflows into multiple sharded files.
   * </pre>
   *

   * @return The uri.
