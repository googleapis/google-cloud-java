/**
 * Service Description: Service to support an API for a store's homepage.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (HomepageServiceClient homepageServiceClient = HomepageServiceClient.create()) {
 *   HomepageName name = HomepageName.of("[ACCOUNT]");
 *   Homepage response = homepageServiceClient.getHomepage(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the HomepageServiceClient object to clean up resources
 * such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls
 * close().

 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of HomepageServiceSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:

 * HomepageServiceSettings homepageServiceSettings =
 *     HomepageServiceSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * HomepageServiceClient homepageServiceClient =
 *     HomepageServiceClient.create(homepageServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.

 * HomepageServiceSettings homepageServiceSettings =
 *     HomepageServiceSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * HomepageServiceClient homepageServiceClient =
 *     HomepageServiceClient.create(homepageServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To use REST (HTTP1.1/JSON) transport (instead of gRPC) for sending and receiving requests over
 * the wire:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
