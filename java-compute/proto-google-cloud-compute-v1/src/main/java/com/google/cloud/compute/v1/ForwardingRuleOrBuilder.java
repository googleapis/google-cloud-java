Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by name, as in: - projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name - regions/region/addresses/address-name - global/addresses/address-name - address-name The forwarding rule's target or backendService, and in most cases, also the loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP address that you can use.
