   * customErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error. If a policy for an error code is not configured for the RouteRule, a policy for the error code configured in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. If one is not specified in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, the policy configured in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: - UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy are configured with policies for 5xx and 4xx errors - A RouteRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for the error code 404. If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is encountered, the policy under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404 response is encountered for the request www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes effect. If however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/ encounters a 404, the policy in RouteRule.customErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If any of the requests in this example encounter a 500 error code, the policy at UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in conjunction with routeRules.routeAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the customErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the customErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is returned to the client. customErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for global external Application Load Balancers.
