This means the autoscaler cannot add or remove instances from the instance group. - MISSING_CUSTOM_METRIC_DATA_POINTS (WARNING): The autoscaler did not receive any data from the custom metric configured for autoscaling. - MISSING_LOAD_BALANCING_DATA_POINTS (WARNING): The autoscaler is configured to scale based on a load balancing signal but the instance group has not received any requests from the load balancer. - MODE_OFF (WARNING): Autoscaling is turned off. The number of instances in the group won't change automatically. The autoscaling configuration is preserved. - MODE_ONLY_UP (WARNING): Autoscaling is in the "Autoscale only out" mode. The autoscaler can add instances but not remove any. - MORE_THAN_ONE_BACKEND_SERVICE (ERROR): The instance group cannot be autoscaled because it has more than one backend service attached to it. - NOT_ENOUGH_QUOTA_AVAILABLE (ERROR): There is insufficient quota for the necessary resources, such as CPU or number of instances. - REGION_RESOURCE_STOCKOUT (ERROR): Shown only for regional autoscalers: there is a resource stockout in the chosen region. - SCALING_TARGET_DOES_NOT_EXIST (ERROR): The target to be scaled does not exist. - UNSUPPORTED_MAX_RATE_LOAD_BALANCING_CONFIGURATION (ERROR): Autoscaling does not work with an HTTP/S load balancer that has been configured for maxRate. - ZONE_RESOURCE_STOCKOUT (ERROR): For zonal autoscalers: there is a resource stockout in the chosen zone.
