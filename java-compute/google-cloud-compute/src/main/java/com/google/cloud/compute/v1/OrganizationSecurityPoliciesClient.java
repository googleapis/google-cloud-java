/**
 * Service Description: The OrganizationSecurityPolicies API.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (OrganizationSecurityPoliciesClient organizationSecurityPoliciesClient =
 *     OrganizationSecurityPoliciesClient.create()) {
 *   String securityPolicy = "securityPolicy-788621166";
 *   SecurityPolicy response = organizationSecurityPoliciesClient.get(securityPolicy);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the OrganizationSecurityPoliciesClient object to clean up
 * resources such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically
 * calls close().
