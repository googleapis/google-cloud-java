   * *   `&lt;field&gt;` can be `name`, `address`, `port`, or `metadata.&lt;key&gt;` for

   * *   `&lt;operator&gt;` can be `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=`, `!=`, `=`, `:`. Of which `:`
   *     means `HAS`, and is roughly the same as `=`
   * *   `&lt;value&gt;` must be the same data type as field
   * *   `&lt;logical connector&gt;` can be `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
   * Examples of valid filters:
   * *   `metadata.owner` returns endpoints that have a annotation with the key
   *     `owner`, this is the same as `metadata:owner`
   * *   `metadata.protocol=gRPC` returns endpoints that have key/value
   *     `protocol=gRPC`
   * *   `address=192.108.1.105` returns endpoints that have this address
   * *   `port&gt;8080` returns endpoints that have port number larger than 8080
   * *
   * `name&gt;projects/my-project/locations/us-east1/namespaces/my-namespace/services/my-service/endpoints/endpoint-c`
   *     returns endpoints that have name that is alphabetically later than the
   *     string, so "endpoint-e" is returned but "endpoint-a" is not
   * *   `metadata.owner!=sd AND metadata.foo=bar` returns endpoints that have
   *     `owner` in annotation key but value is not `sd` AND have key/value
   *      `foo=bar`
   * *   `doesnotexist.foo=bar` returns an empty list. Note that endpoint
   *     doesn't have a field called "doesnotexist". Since the filter does not
   *     match any endpoint, it returns no results
