   * Output only. The max burst size.
   * Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when
   * many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field
   * allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly
   * after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when
   * many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.
   * The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket)
   * algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each
   * queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum
   * specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a
   * token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until
   * the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be
   * continuously refilled with new tokens based on
   * [max_tasks_dispatched_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.RateLimits.max_tasks_dispatched_per_second].
   * Cloud Tasks will pick the value of `max_burst_size` based on the
   * value of
   * [max_tasks_dispatched_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.RateLimits.max_tasks_dispatched_per_second].
   * For App Engine queues that were created or updated using
   * `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to
   * [bucket_size](/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size).
   * Since `max_burst_size` is output only, if
   * [UpdateQueue][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.UpdateQueue] is called on a queue
   * created by `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` will be reset based
   * on the value of
   * [max_tasks_dispatched_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.RateLimits.max_tasks_dispatched_per_second],
   * regardless of whether
   * [max_tasks_dispatched_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.RateLimits.max_tasks_dispatched_per_second]
   * is updated.
