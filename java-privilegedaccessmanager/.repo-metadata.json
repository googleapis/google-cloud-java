  "api_description": "Privileged Access Manager (PAM) helps you on your journey towards least     privilege and helps mitigate risks tied to privileged access misuse or     abuse. PAM allows you to shift from always-on standing privileges towards     on-demand access with just-in-time, time-bound, and approval-based access     elevations. PAM allows IAM administrators to create entitlements that can     grant just-in-time, temporary access to any resource scope. Requesters can     explore eligible entitlements and request the access needed for their     task. Approvers are notified when approvals await their     decision. Streamlined workflows facilitated by using PAM can support     various use cases, including emergency access for incident responders,     time-boxed access for developers for critical deployment or maintenance,     temporary access for operators for data ingestion and audits, JIT access     to service accounts for automated tasks, and more.",
