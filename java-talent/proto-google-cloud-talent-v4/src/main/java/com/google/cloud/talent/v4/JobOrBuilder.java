   * The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the
   * job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The
   * expired job can't be listed by the
   * [ListJobs][google.cloud.talent.v4.JobService.ListJobs] API, but it can be
   * retrieved with the [GetJob][google.cloud.talent.v4.JobService.GetJob] API
   * or updated with the
   * [UpdateJob][google.cloud.talent.v4.JobService.UpdateJob] API or deleted
   * with the [DeleteJob][google.cloud.talent.v4.JobService.DeleteJob] API. An
   * expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration
   * timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open
   * job with same [company][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.company],
   * [language_code][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.language_code] and
   * [requisition_id][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.requisition_id].
   *
   * The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the
   * overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of
   * open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded,
   * expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time.
   * Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned
   * out.
   *
   * Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided.
   *
   * If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job
   * is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can
   * not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the
   * [posting_publish_time][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.posting_publish_time]
   * must be set before
   * [posting_expire_time][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.posting_expire_time]. The
   * purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as
   * [ApplicationInfo][google.cloud.talent.v4.Job.ApplicationInfo], to refer a
   * job that didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want
   * to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new
   * one.
   *
   * If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid,
   * the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For
   * example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an
   * unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.
