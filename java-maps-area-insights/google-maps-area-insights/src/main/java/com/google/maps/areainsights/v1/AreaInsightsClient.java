/**
 * Service Description: Service definition for the Places Insights API.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (AreaInsightsClient areaInsightsClient = AreaInsightsClient.create()) {
 *   ComputeInsightsRequest request =
 *       ComputeInsightsRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .addAllInsights(new ArrayList<Insight>())
 *           .setFilter(Filter.newBuilder().build())
 *           .build();
 *   ComputeInsightsResponse response = areaInsightsClient.computeInsights(request);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the AreaInsightsClient object to clean up resources such
 * as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().
 *

 *      <td><p> Compute Insights RPC
 * <p>  This method lets you retrieve insights about areas using a variaty of filter such as: area, place type, operating status, price level and ratings. Currently "count" and "places" insights are supported. With "count" insights you can answer questions such as "How many restaurant are located in California that are operational, are inexpensive and have an average rating of at least 4 stars" (see `insight` enum for more details). With "places" insights, you can determine which places match the requested filter. Clients can then use those place resource names to fetch more details about each individual place using the Places API.</td>
 *      <td>
 *      <p>Request object method variants only take one parameter, a request object, which must be constructed before the call.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *           <li><p> computeInsights(ComputeInsightsRequest request)
 *      </ul>
 *      <p>Callable method variants take no parameters and return an immutable API callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *           <li><p> computeInsightsCallable()
 *      </ul>
 *       </td>
 *    </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of AreaInsightsSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * AreaInsightsSettings areaInsightsSettings =
 *     AreaInsightsSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * AreaInsightsClient areaInsightsClient = AreaInsightsClient.create(areaInsightsSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * AreaInsightsSettings areaInsightsSettings =
 *     AreaInsightsSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * AreaInsightsClient areaInsightsClient = AreaInsightsClient.create(areaInsightsSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To use REST (HTTP1.1/JSON) transport (instead of gRPC) for sending and receiving requests over
 * the wire:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * AreaInsightsSettings areaInsightsSettings = AreaInsightsSettings.newHttpJsonBuilder().build();
 * AreaInsightsClient areaInsightsClient = AreaInsightsClient.create(areaInsightsSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
