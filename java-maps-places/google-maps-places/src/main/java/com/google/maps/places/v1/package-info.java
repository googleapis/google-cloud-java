/**
 * A client to Places API (New)
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= PlacesClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Service definition for the Places API. Note: every request (except for
 * Autocomplete and GetPhotoMedia requests) requires a field mask set outside of the request proto
 * (`all/&#42;`, is not assumed). The field mask can be set via the HTTP header `X-Goog-FieldMask`.
 * See: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/choose-fields
 *
 * <p>Sample for PlacesClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (PlacesClient placesClient = PlacesClient.create()) {
 *   SearchNearbyRequest request =
 *       SearchNearbyRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setLanguageCode("languageCode-2092349083")
 *           .setRegionCode("regionCode-1991004415")
 *           .addAllIncludedTypes(new ArrayList<String>())
 *           .addAllExcludedTypes(new ArrayList<String>())
 *           .addAllIncludedPrimaryTypes(new ArrayList<String>())
 *           .addAllExcludedPrimaryTypes(new ArrayList<String>())
 *           .setMaxResultCount(-1736124056)
 *           .setLocationRestriction(SearchNearbyRequest.LocationRestriction.newBuilder().build())
 *           .setRoutingParameters(RoutingParameters.newBuilder().build())
 *           .build();
 *   SearchNearbyResponse response = placesClient.searchNearby(request);
