    use, rotate, and destroy AES256, RSA 2048, RSA 3072, RSA 4096, EC P256, and EC
    P384 cryptographic keys. Cloud KMS is integrated with Cloud IAM and Cloud Audit
    Logging so that you can manage permissions on individual keys and monitor how
    these are used. Use Cloud KMS to protect secrets and other sensitive data that
    you need to store in Google Cloud Platform.

    await their decision. Streamlined workflows facilitated by using PAM can support
    various use cases, including emergency access for incident responders, time-boxed
    access for developers for critical deployment or maintenance, temporary access
    for operators for data ingestion and audits, JIT access to service accounts for
