# New client generation (GitHub Action)
This new generation workflow enables generation of new libraries by
 1. Appending a new library to our [generation_config.yaml](/generation_config.yaml).
 2. Creating a PR with the changes. 

The new client will be generated by [Hermetic library generation workflow](/.github/workflows/hermetic_library_generation.yaml).


## Components
### `new_library_hermetic_build/add-new-client-config.py`
This script takes 10 arguments that map to items in the newly added library that
goes in `generation_config.yaml`.
A new entry will be added to `libraries` with the necessary generation
configuration.

### `.github/workflows/generate_new_client_hermetic_build.yaml`
This workflow orchestrates the `add-new-client-config.py` script and creates
a pull request.


## Execute the GitHub Action

In order to run the
[GitHub Action](/.github/workflows/generate_new_client_hermetic_build.yaml),
you need to specify a few parameters.
These parameters will be available in the Cloud Drop link (a YAML file) included
in the Buganizer request.
The example in this README uses AlloyDB's [Cloud Drop](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/cloud/alloydb/v1/alloydb_v1.yaml)
file as an example.

### API short name (`api_shortname`)

As a convenience for the subsequent commands, we need an identifier for the
library, called `api_shortname`.
This identifier will be used by default to generate the following:
* `--distribution-name`
* `--library_name`

The corresponding value in the Cloud Drop page is `api_short_name`.

Example: `alloydb`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `api_short_name` is not always unique across client libraries.
> In the instance that the `api_short_name` is already in use by an existing
> client library, you will need to determine a unique name OR to pass a unique
> `library_name`.
> See [Advanced Options](#advanced-options).

### Proto path (`proto_path`)

This is the path from the internal `google3/third_party/googleapis/stable` root
to the directory that contains the proto definitions for a specific version.
For example: `google/datastore/v2`. 
Root-level proto paths like `google/datastore` are not supported.
Note that the internal `google3/third_party/googleapis/stable` directory is
mirrored externally in https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/.

For example, if the Buganizer ticket includes:

> Link to protos: `http://...(omit).../google/cloud/alloydb/v1alpha/alloydb_v1alpha.yaml`.

then the corresponding external mirrored proto is here: `https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/cloud/alloydb/v1alpha/alloydb_v1alpha.yaml`.

Therefore, the "proto path" value we supply to the command is
`google/cloud/alloydb/v1alpha`.

We will publish a single module for a service that includes the specified version
(in the example, `v1alpha`).
Any future version must be manually added to the configuration yaml (`google-cloud-java/generation_config.yaml`)

#### More than one `proto_path`

If you need another `proto_path` in the library, you must manually add it
to `google-cloud-java/generation_config.yaml` after generating the new client.

### Name pretty (`name_pretty`)

The corresponding value in the Cloud Drop page is `title`.

Example: `AlloyDB API`

### Product Docs (`product_docs`)

The corresponding value in the Cloud Drop page is `documentation_uri`.
The value must starts with "https://".

Example: `https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs`

### REST Docs (`rest_docs`)

The corresponding value in the Cloud Drop page is `rest_reference_documentation_uri`.
The value must starts with "https://".

Example: `https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/reference/rest`

If the value exists, add it as a flag to the python command below (see [Advanced
Options](#advanced-options):
`--rest-docs="https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/reference/rest" \`

### RPC Docs (`rpc_docs`)

The corresponding value in the Cloud Drop page is `proto_reference_documentation_uri`.
The value must starts with "https://".

Example: `https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/reference/rpc`

If the value exists, add it as a flag to the python command below (see [Advanced
Options](#advanced-options):
`--rpc-docs="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/reference/rpc" \`

### API description (`api_description`)

The corresponding value in the Cloud Drop page is `documentation.summary` or `documentation.overview`.
If both of those fields are missing, take the description from the product page
above.
Use the first sentence to keep it concise.

Example:
``` 
    AlloyDB for PostgreSQL is an open source-compatible database service that
    provides a powerful option for migrating, modernizing, or building
    commercial-grade applications.
 ```

### Distribution Name (`distribution_name`)

This variable determines the Maven coordinates of the generated library.
It defaults to `com.google.cloud:google-cloud-{api_shortname}`.
This mainly affect the values in the generated `pom.xml` files.

### Library Name (`library_name`)

This variable indicates the output folder of the library.
For example, you can have two libraries with `alloydb`
(AlloyDB and AlloyDB Connectors) as `api_shortname`. 
In order to avoid both libraries going to the default `java-alloydb` folder,
we can override this behavior by specifying a value like `alloydb-connectors`
so the AlloyDB Connectors goes to `java-alloydb-connectors`.

## Advanced Options

In case the steps above don't show you how to specify the desired options, you
can run the `add-new-client-config.py` script in your local environment. 
The advanced options not shown in the section above **cannot be specified in
the GitHub Action**, hence the need for a local run (refer to the "Prerequisites
(for local environment)" section).
For the explanation of the available parameters, run:
```
python3.9 generation/new_client_hermetic_build/add-new-client-config.py generate  --help
```

After you run the script, you will see that the `generation_config.yaml` file
was modified (or the script exited because the library already existed).

Please create a PR explaining what commands you used and make sure the
add-new-client-config.py arguments were listed).
