   * Typical uses for contexts:
   * 1) You are using Vizier to tune a server for best performance, but there's
   *   a strong weekly cycle.  The context specifies the day-of-week.
   *   This allows Tuesday to generalize from Wednesday without assuming that

   *   As they walk in the door, you know certain facts about them
   *   (e.g. sex, weight, height, blood-pressure).  Put that information in the
   *   context, and Vizier will adapt its suggestions to the patient.
   * 3) You want to do a fair A/B test efficiently.  Specify the "A" and "B"
   *   conditions as contexts, and Vizier will generalize between "A" and "B"
   *   conditions.  If they are similar, this will allow Vizier to converge
   *   to the optimum faster than if "A" and "B" were separate Studies.
   *   NOTE: You can also enter contexts as REQUESTED Trials, e.g. via the
   *   CreateTrial() RPC; that's the asynchronous option where you don't need a
   *   close association between contexts and suggestions.
   *
   * NOTE: All the Parameters you set in a context MUST be defined in the
   *   Study.
   * NOTE: You must supply 0 or $suggestion_count contexts.
   *   If you don't supply any contexts, Vizier will make suggestions
   *   from the full search space specified in the StudySpec; if you supply
   *   a full set of context, each suggestion will match the corresponding
   *   context.
   * NOTE: A Context with no features set matches anything, and allows
   *   suggestions from the full search space.
   * NOTE: Contexts MUST lie within the search space specified in the
   *   StudySpec.  It's an error if they don't.

     *
     * Typical uses for contexts:
     * 1) You are using Vizier to tune a server for best performance, but there's
     *   a strong weekly cycle.  The context specifies the day-of-week.

     * 2) Imagine you're optimizing some medical treatment for people.
     *   As they walk in the door, you know certain facts about them
     *   (e.g. sex, weight, height, blood-pressure).  Put that information in the
     *   context, and Vizier will adapt its suggestions to the patient.
     * 3) You want to do a fair A/B test efficiently.  Specify the "A" and "B"
     *   conditions as contexts, and Vizier will generalize between "A" and "B"
     *   conditions.  If they are similar, this will allow Vizier to converge
     *   to the optimum faster than if "A" and "B" were separate Studies.
     *   NOTE: You can also enter contexts as REQUESTED Trials, e.g. via the
     *   CreateTrial() RPC; that's the asynchronous option where you don't need a
     *   close association between contexts and suggestions.
